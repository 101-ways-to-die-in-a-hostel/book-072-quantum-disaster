# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Theodore "Theo" Park-Sato
**Nickname/Handle:** @QuantumNomad
**Age:** 26
**Nationality:** American (Korean-Japanese heritage, raised in Massachusetts)
**Occupation:** Physics PhD dropout / "Independent Researcher"

## Archetype
**Primary:** Tech Bro / Pseudointellectual

**Secondary traits:** Failed academic seeking validation, conspiracy theorist adjacent, "too smart for the system"

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Arrogance

**How it manifests:**
- Believes his intelligence exempts him from consequences
- Assumes theoretical knowledge equals practical competence
- Dismisses warnings as coming from people "who don't understand the math"

**How it kills them:**
Theo acquires an experimental quantum observation device from a black-market dealer in Geneva. He activates it in the hostel basement, hoping to "glimpse parallel timelines." Instead, he shifts his consciousness into a timeline where he was never born, and that reality rejects him like a body rejecting a transplant.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 5'10", thin, perpetual grad-student posture
- **Hair:** Black, perpetually messy, hasn't been cut in months
- **Distinguishing features:** Dark circles under eyes, nervous energy, constantly adjusting glasses
- **Typical outfit:** Band t-shirts from physics conferences, cargo pants with too many pockets, a jacket with CERN patches he bought on eBay

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Genuinely brilliant mind - becomes overconfidence that ignores practical limits
2. Passionate curiosity - becomes reckless pursuit of forbidden knowledge

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Intellectual snobbery - leads to dismissing legitimate warnings from non-scientists
2. Desperate need to prove himself - leads to dangerous shortcuts

### Pet Peeves
- People who misuse scientific terms
- "Pop science" explanations
- Being asked to explain things to non-experts

### Fears
- Being ordinary
- That his PhD dropout was a mistake
- That everyone else was right about him

## Background

### Origin Story
Child of a quantum physicist mother and an engineer father who divorced when he was 12. Raised to believe he was exceptional. Breezed through MIT undergrad, crashed hard in the Stanford PhD program when he realized being smart wasn't enough. Dropped out after his advisor told him his theories were "interesting but unworkable." Has spent two years traveling and trying to prove them right independently.

### Why They Travel
Running from the failure of his academic career. Seeking validation through "real-world applications" of his theories. Chasing rumors of underground physics experiments happening outside institutional oversight.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Heard through dark web forums that a hostel near CERN was a meeting point for black-market quantum tech traders. Came specifically to acquire a prototype quantum observation device that "fell off the back of a hadron collider."

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "quantum," "theoretically," "probabilistically," "actually," "fundamentally"
- Avoids words like: "magic," "impossible," "don't know"
- Catchphrases: "Well, actually...", "The math checks out," "You wouldn't understand, but..."

### Speech Pattern
- Lectures rather than converses
- Interrupts with corrections
- Uses technical jargon to assert dominance
- Can't resist explaining things people didn't ask about

### Internal Monologue Style
Constantly narrating his own genius. Comparing himself favorably to others. Rehearsing future speeches for when he's vindicated.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Twitter/X (for physics arguments) and Reddit (r/physics, r/conspiracy)
- **Follower count:** 3,400 (mostly people who enjoy watching him argue)
- **Posting style:** Thread-length explanations of theories no one asked about, subtweeting former colleagues
- **Last post before death:** "Found what I was looking for. The Copenhagen interpretation is about to become very personal. Updates soon."

### Online vs Reality
Presents himself as a misunderstood genius when he's really a smart person who couldn't handle not being the smartest in the room. His "independent research" is mostly reading papers in coffee shops.

## Relationships

### Family
- Estranged from physicist mother who sided with his Stanford advisor
- Occasional texts with father who doesn't understand what went wrong

### Friends
- Online friends in physics forums who find him exhausting but interesting
- No one he'd call in an emergency

### Romantic
- Single; last relationship ended when she got tired of being lectured

### At the Hostel
- Initially dismissive of other travelers as "non-technical"
- Reluctantly bonds with a Swiss PhD student who validates his theories
- Suspicious of the hostel staff, correctly

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes up excited. Today's the day. Checks the device he acquired last night. Spends an hour writing a "just in case" letter to his mother he knows he won't send. Skips breakfast because his stomach is too knotted.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Sharing a coffee with Elise, the Swiss student, who tells him his theories are "not impossible." The first real validation he's had in years. For a moment, he considers not running the experiment.

### Final Thoughts
*The math was right. The math was RIGHT. So why is this happening? Why doesn't anyone recognize me? Why am I becoming transparent? Mom was wrong. Stanford was wrong. I was RIGHT. The equations don't lie. The equations don't--*

### Last Words
"This isn't... I'm supposed to exist... I'M SUPPOSED TO EXIST..."

## Writing This Character

### POV Notes
When in this character's head:
- They notice: Technical details, equipment, potential physics applications
- They ignore: Social cues, emotional undertones, non-technical dangers
- They judge: Intelligence hierarchies, instantly categorizing people by perceived IQ

### Key Scenes Checklist
- [ ] Introduction scene establishing archetype - Theo correcting a bartender about how ice melts
- [ ] Fatal flaw demonstration (early) - Dismissing the dealer's warnings about the device
- [ ] Sympathetic moment (make reader care) - Drunk confession about Stanford, his mother's disappointment
- [ ] Warning ignored scene - Device instructions specifically warn about "timeline contamination"
- [ ] Point of no return - Activating the device in the basement
- [ ] The death - Reality erasing him as he screams that the math was right
