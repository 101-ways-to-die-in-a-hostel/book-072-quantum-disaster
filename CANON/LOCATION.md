# Location Profile

## The Hostel

**Name:** Bunker 23 Backpackers
**Type:** Historic / Alternative
**Star Rating:** 3.5 on Hostelworld (mixed reviews about the "weird vibe")
**Price Range:** CHF 35-55 per night

### History
Originally built in 1962 as a civil defense bunker during the Cold War. Decommissioned in 1991 after the Soviet collapse. Converted to a hostel in 2004 by an eccentric physicist who worked at CERN and believed the underground location had "interesting properties." He disappeared in 2008. The current owners don't ask questions about the basement.

### Architecture
- **Style:** Brutalist bunker converted with modern hostel touches
- **Floors:** 1 above ground (reception, common areas), 2 underground (dorms, basement)
- **Total beds:** 48
- **Notable features:** Reinforced concrete walls 2 meters thick, original blast doors repurposed as room dividers, a "meditation room" that was once the command center, a lowest basement level that's "off-limits for renovation"

### Layout
```
Ground Level (Street):
- Reception (in what was the bunker entrance)
- Common room (natural light through narrow windows)
- Kitchen and dining area
- Small garden courtyard (in the old vehicle access)

Sublevel 1 (-4 meters):
- 6-bed dorm rooms (x4)
- 4-bed dorm rooms (x2)
- Private rooms (x3)
- Shared bathrooms (originally decontamination showers)
- Laundry room

Sublevel 2 (-8 meters, "off-limits"):
- The old command center (now storage)
- Generator room (still functional)
- "The Quiet Room" - sealed door, no one has the key
- Emergency exit tunnel (collapsed)
```

### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
Sublevel 2, in the old generator room that Theo accessed by picking the lock. A concrete chamber with humming electrical equipment that hasn't been updated since the 60s. The walls are lined with old Soviet radiation monitors (the bunker's original equipment came through East German channels). Strange graffiti that appears and disappears covers one wall - messages from people who may or may not have existed. Theo sets up the device here because the Faraday cage effect of the concrete provides "clean" electromagnetic conditions.

## The City

**City:** Meyrin (commune near Geneva)
**Country:** Switzerland
**Population:** ~25,000 (within CERN's sphere of influence)
**Known for:** CERN, the Large Hadron Collider, international physics community, a bizarre number of missing persons cases among visiting researchers

### Geography
- **Climate:** Continental European, cold winters, mild summers
- **Terrain:** Suburban sprawl between Geneva and the Jura Mountains
- **Weather during story:** Early spring, grey skies, occasional rain, the kind of weather that makes everything feel slightly unreal

### Culture
- **Language(s):** French primarily, English widely spoken due to CERN
- **Religion(s):** Secular/Catholic
- **Customs relevant to story:** Swiss discretion - people mind their own business. If someone disappears, it's not polite to ask questions.

### Tourist Scene
- **Backpacker popularity:** Low for tourists, medium for "science tourists" and CERN visitors
- **Type of tourists:** Physics enthusiasts, CERN employees' visiting families, conspiracy theorists investigating the LHC
- **Danger level:** Very safe (per guidebooks), but an unusual number of CERN visitors have gone missing over the years (officially attributed to "the transient nature of the scientific community")

## Sensory Environment

### Sounds
- Morning: Quiet suburb sounds, occasional CERN shuttle buses
- Afternoon: Distant hum that locals say comes from the LHC (though it shouldn't be audible)
- Night: Absolute silence underground, the kind that has weight
- Unique sounds: The generator room has a subsonic vibration that you feel in your teeth

### Smells
- Hostel: Industrial cleaning products, coffee, the metallic tang of old concrete
- Street: Rain on pavement, bread from the nearby bakery
- Specific to death location: Ozone, old electronics, something that smells like burning that isn't burning

### Textures
- Surfaces: Cold concrete, industrial metal, repurposed military furniture
- Climate feel: Always slightly too cold underground, dampness that seeps into everything

### Tastes
- Local food: Swiss-French cuisine, cheese, chocolate, CERN cafeteria food (surprisingly good)
- Hostel offerings: Basic continental breakfast, vending machines, a "DIY fondue night" on Thursdays

### Visual Details
- Colors: Grey concrete, industrial yellow warning paint, fluorescent lighting that buzzes
- Light quality: Harsh and artificial underground, the flicker that never quite stops
- Distinctive visuals: Radiation warning signs that are "just decorative," blast door handles, the way shadows seem to move differently down here

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Pierre Duchamp
**Description:** Mid-50s, former CERN contractor, took the hostel job after a "breakdown." Knows more than he says. Has a thousand-yard stare when guests ask about the basement.
**Role in death:** Warning-giver who isn't believed. Tried to keep Theo out of the basement. Wasn't surprised when Theo vanished, though he has no memory of Theo.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Maria Santos | Refuses to clean below sublevel 1, crosses herself when the topic comes up |
| Night Manager | Jan Kowalski | Physics student, thinks the "spooky" reputation is marketing, will unlock doors for bribes |
| Maintenance | None | Equipment gets fixed, but no one knows who does it |
| Owner | Unknown | Rent is paid to a Swiss trust; no one has met the actual owner |

### Staff Knowledge
Pierre knows something is wrong with the basement. Maria has seen things she won't discuss. Jan is oblivious. The absent owner may be the original physicist who "disappeared" - or may never have existed at all.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Quiet, studious. Guests are often CERN visitors writing papers in the common room. Conversations tend toward physics, philosophy of science, whether the LHC could really destroy the world.

### Night Vibe
Unsettling. The silence is too complete. Guests report hearing things that aren't there. Some complain of vivid dreams about being in two places at once. The sublevel 2 door rattles sometimes, even though it's locked.

### Guest Demographics
Physics students, CERN tourists, conspiracy theorists, and occasionally backpackers who booked it accidentally thinking "bunker" was aesthetic rather than literal.

### Reputation
Mixed reviews: praised for cleanliness and price, criticized for "weird vibes," "dreams," and one review that just says "I don't remember staying here but I have the receipt."

## Practical Details

### Getting There
- Tram from Geneva (15 minutes)
- Walk from CERN visitor center (10 minutes)
- The hostel is deliberately hard to find, tucked behind a nondescript concrete facade

### Check-in Process
Standard, except for a waiver that includes the line "the hostel is not responsible for temporal, psychological, or ontological disturbances." Guests laugh. Staff don't.

### Rules
- No entry to sublevel 2 (guests find a way anyway)
- Quiet hours 10 PM - 8 AM (the silence is enforced by something other than staff)
- Report any "unusual experiences" to reception (no one ever does)

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: excellent, CERN fiber)
- [x] Kitchen
- [x] Lockers (Cold War era, built to survive nuclear blast)
- [x] Laundry
- [ ] Pool
- [x] Bar (small, serves Swiss beer and questionable absinthe)
- [ ] Rooftop (there is no roof to speak of)
- [x] Tours offered (CERN visitor center tours, unofficial "weird physics sites" tours)
- [x] Other: "Meditation room" that causes headaches

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- CERN location and operations should be accurate
- Swiss bunker history and civil defense is real
- Meyrin is a real commune with real CERN connections
- The LHC hum is fictional but based on local rumors

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Swiss culture portrayed accurately
- CERN scientists portrayed with respect (the hostel guests are fringe researchers, not mainstream)
- No real conspiracy theories endorsed

### Sources
- CERN visitor center documentation
- Swiss civil defense bunker records
- Interviews with Meyrin residents
- Physics forums discussing LHC rumors
